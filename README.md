GitHub with CLion


Clone a GitHub repository into CLion*
Click the green "â¤“ Code" button from the GitHub repository page and copy the HTTPS link.
Note that if the repository is empty, there will not be a green button and the HTTPS link will already be visible.
You may need to install Git on your machine (you should only have to do this once).
Now switch to CLion:

If you do not already have a project open in CLion, choose Get from Version Control from the main menu.
In the window that pops up, choose Git from the dropdown menu.
Paste the link from GitHub in the URL textbox.
The Directory textbox is where CLion will create a folder for the project. Change it if the default directory is not where you want it.
Click Clone.
You may be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password.
It will ask you if you want to open the directory. Choose yes.
